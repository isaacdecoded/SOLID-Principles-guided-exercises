# SOLID Principles guided exercises

This is a monorepo that contains walk-through exercises for the Object-Oriented Programming SOLID principles.
The /starting-point directory describes an object named MessageStore that serves as a message storing on disk files.

# Objective 🎯

Using the object class defined at /starting_point/MessageStore.ts file (starting from a perspective that code contains many things to improve, lets think it's a real legacy file and some mistakes has been made deliberately 😉), start refactoring it by implementing the SOLID principles. Each directory contains a basic explanation of the respective principle and a guide for the challenge.

As this exercise is a walk-through, it's important to start refactoring from Single Responsibility Principle.

# Extra

As you refactor, think about and analyse each improvement you would make, e.g. definitions changes or fixes, best practices, code duplication solving, etc., take a few notes and respond to them to consolidate the knowledge recognizing multiple perspectives or scenarios.
