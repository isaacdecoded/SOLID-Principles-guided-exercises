# SOLID Principles guided exercises

This is a monorepo that contains walk-through exercises for the Object-Oriented Programming SOLID principles.
The /starting-point directory describes an object named MessageStore that serves as a message storing in disk files.

# Objective

Using the object class defined at /start/MessageStore.ts file (starting from a perspective that code contains many things to improve, lets think it's a real legacy file and some mistakes has been made deliberately ðŸ˜‰), start refactoring it by implementing the SOLID principles. Each directory contains a basic explanation of the respective principle and a guide for the challenge.

As this exercise is a walk-through, it's important to start refactoring from Single Responsibility Principle.

# Extra

As you refactor, think about and analyse each improvement you would make, e.g. definitions changes or fixes, best practices, code duplication, etc., take a few notes and respond to them to consolide the knowledge recognizing multiple perspectives or scenarios.
